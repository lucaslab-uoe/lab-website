I'm interested in probabilistic machine learning and its application to environmental problems. My PhD project is about finding methods for efficiently sampling urban air pollution. New low-cost sensors mean many more locations can be sampled, but with higher uncertainty. We're using Bayesian optimisation to model pollution levels and uncertainties in an area, and to determine where to sample next. Our goal is for the method to be usable for real-time sampling, e.g. directing a person with a sensor around a town of interest. 

Iâ€™m a member of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science, supervised by Nigel Goddard and Chris Lucas.
