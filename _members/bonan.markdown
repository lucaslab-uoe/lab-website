How do people adapt to new environments based on past experiences? How are we able to construct new world models so efficiently from existing ones? I use program induction and probabilistic programming models together with online interactive games to unveil the computations our mind might be doing.

I am funded by a PhD Research Award from the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
