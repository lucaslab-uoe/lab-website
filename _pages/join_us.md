<p>If you'd like to pursue a Ph.D. and might be interested in
  working with me, <a href="mailto:c.lucas@ed.ac.uk">send me an email</a> with some info about your
  research interests and academic background. It would be great if you
  could include a CV or a link to your homepage.
</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer questions, and may be able
  to meet if you're around Edinburgh.
  </p>
<p>
  If you're not familiar with my research, you can take a look at some of
  my publications to get a sense of what I do. You can also see examples of Ph.D. project topics for my institute
  <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study/possible-phd-topics-in-ilcc">here</a>.
 </p>
<p>It's a good idea to contact prospective supervisors sooner rather
   than later, because Edinburgh matches students to supervisors
   quite early, and more funding opportunities tend to be available
   if one starts earlier. It may also be helpful to note in your application that you are interested
   in working with me.
