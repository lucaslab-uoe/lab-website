### Information for prospective students
If you'd like to pursue a Ph.D. and might be interested in working us, <a href="mailto:c.lucas@ed.ac.uk">send Chris an email</a> with some info about your research interests and academic background. It would be great if you could include a CV or a link to your homepage.

If you're not familiar with our research, you can take a look at [some of our selected publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) to get a sense of what we do. You can also see examples of Ph.D. project topics for our main institute (ILCC) <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study/possible-phd-topics-in-ilcc" target="_blank">here</a>.

It's a good idea to contact prospective supervisors sooner rather than later, because Edinburgh matches students to supervisors quite early, and more funding opportunities tend to be available if one starts earlier. It may also be helpful to note in your application that you are interested in working with Chris.
