### Information for prospective students
If you'd like to pursue a Ph.D. and might be interested in working with me, <a href="mailto:c.lucas@ed.ac.uk">send me an email</a> with some info about your research interests and academic background. It would be great if you could include a CV or a link to your homepage.

I'm happy to answer questions, and may be able to meet if you're around Edinburgh.

If you're not familiar with my research, you can take a look at [some of my publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) to get a sense of what I do. You can also see examples of Ph.D. project topics for my institute <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study/possible-phd-topics-in-ilcc" target="_blank">here</a>.

It's a good idea to contact prospective supervisors sooner rather than later, because Edinburgh matches students to supervisors quite early, and more funding opportunities tend to be available if one starts earlier. It may also be helpful to note in your application that you are interested in working with me.
